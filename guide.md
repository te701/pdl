Deutsche Boerse uses GitHub.com in cases of external collaboration, open source software developement or in case of experimentation.  
This guide should give you basic understanding of reasons, why, when and how to use repositories under this organisation.

Dos and Don'ts
--------------

**DO:**  
- ask for legal approval to use repositories within this organization
- multi factor authentication
- maintain your teams and repositories accordingly

**DO NOT:**

- store third party software in our repositories
- invite users without letting others know
- forget we already got Open Source Software policy

What should go to GitHub.com?
-----------------------------

Generally speaking, any company owned code shall be stored on GitHub Enterprise instance.  
In case of **open source development**, you can ask for access to this organization and use GitHub.com properly.  
In case of external collaborators (typically within Product Development Lab), for easier communication, invite relevant people and use **private repository** to store your work.  

How to get access and support?
------------------------------

Best via email to our internal GitHub support (assuming this organization is handled under GitHub Enterprise support group).
